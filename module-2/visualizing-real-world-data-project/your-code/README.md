# Visualizing Real World Data Project

## Overview

This project is going to set basis for the previous learnings that we saw durign the module-2. 

We are going analise and try to discover interesting outcomes and how to represent them from a Real World data base.

#### First Step: 

We should download a Real world Database, there are numerous website where you can donwload this kind of data. However we have  a favourite: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

 #### Second Step:

We need to create or have access to a data work place to be able to manipulate this kind of documents. 

For this specific project the tools that we must use is [Jupyter-Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

You can learn more visiting there web.

Once you have install jupiter you create a file on "Python 3" call "Analysis":

 - In this folder we are going to call the dataset
 - Create a DATAFRAME
 - And manage the differents graph that we are going to use

#### Third Step:

You must create a new file on Jupyter call "Presentation", where we are going to :v:Make a Presentation :v: of the project.

Wich kind of graph we should represent on the project:

:bar_chart:Bar chart

:chart_with_upwards_trend:Bar line

:world_map:Maps

:sweat:Heat Maps
